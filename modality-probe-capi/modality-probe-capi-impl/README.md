# ekotrace-capi-impl

This crate is a Rust library containing C-friendly adapters
of the essential [ekotrace](../../) functions.

The [ekotrace-capi](../ekotrace-capi) project is the primary
user of this library. These two projects are separated in order to
allow alternate implementations of the panic-handling
apparatus required by Rust libraries built for C.

If you're looking to get started with using `ekotrace` from C,
you should probably be using [ekotrace-capi](../ekotrace-capi)
instead.
